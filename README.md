__docker run -it -p 8888:8888 eae3532/practicals__  
  
This will pull the image from Docker Hub when run for the first time.  
You can then open a browser at  
  
__http://dockervirtualhostIP:8888__
  
where the docker virtualhostIP appears at the top of the docker terminal.  
  
eg. __http://192.168.99.100:8888__  

Copy and paste the token from the terminal to Jupyter load screen.
